Easy wallpaper slideshow for keyless windows 10.

Are you using a windows install from when microsoft used to hand free copies of windows 10? You probably can't use the 'Personalize' menu then. Fear not! Add this script to your startup with a folder full of wallpapers and an interval, and it will behave exactly the same.
